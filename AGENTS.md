# Agent Instructions

This repository consumes the Sylphx engineering doctrine from [SylphxAI/doctrine](https://github.com/SylphxAI/doctrine).

Before changing files here:

- Read [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) and [`.doctrine/project.json`](./.doctrine/project.json) for this repository's goal, lifecycle, boundary, public surfaces, and adoption gaps.
- Read `SylphxAI/doctrine` `AGENTS.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, and `ADR.md`, then load any triggered standards.
- Keep CodeRAG behavior generic to code search and MCP retrieval; consuming assistants and IDEs own their local configuration and UX.

Do not add customer-specific indexing, provider, or assistant behavior here. This repository owns CodeRAG packages only.
