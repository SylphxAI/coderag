# coderag — local agent notes only

Static engineering and delivery standards load from the active Skills runtime
([SylphxAI/skills](https://github.com/SylphxAI/skills) is binding instruction
SSOT). Doctrine and Mission Control are retired historical lineage and must not
be loaded as current instruction authority.

Local truth: `PROJECT.md`, `.doctrine/project.json` when present.

## Boundary hazards

- Never commit secrets, tokens, `.env` files, or credentials.

## Local commands

- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run build`
- `cargo test --workspace`
- Prefer the **narrowest** affected check before full workspace runs.
- Report layers honestly: local diff · trunk FF · deploy · prod proof (do not collapse).

## Validation notes

- Prefer the **narrowest** affected check before full workspace runs.
- Report layers honestly: local diff · trunk FF · deploy · prod proof (do not collapse).
