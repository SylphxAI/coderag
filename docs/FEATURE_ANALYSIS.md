## ❌ Critical Missing Features

### 1. Testing (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Status:** ⚠️ No tests at all

**Missing:**
- Unit tests for TF-IDF algorithms
- Integration tests for indexing pipeline
- MCP tool tests
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarks

**Impact:** Production readiness blocked, high risk of regressions

**Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
- Core tests: 1 week
- MCP tests: 3 days
- Integration tests: 3 days
- Coverage setup: 1 day

---

### 2. Persistent Index (Priority: HIGH)
**Status:** ❌ In-memory only

**Current Limitation:**
- Index lost on server restart
- Must re-index entire codebase every time
- No state preservation

**Needed:**
- SQLite storage backend
- Serialize/deserialize TF-IDF vectors
- File metadata persistence (hash, mtime)
- Index versioning

**Impact:** Poor UX for large codebases (re-indexing delay on restart)

**Estimate:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 3. Incremental Indexing (Priority: HIGH)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented in v1.1.0

**Completed:**
- ✅ File change detection (add, change, delete events)
- ✅ Automatic re-indexing on file changes
- ✅ Watch mode with chokidar
- ✅ Debounced updates (500ms)
- ✅ .gitignore integration for watch

**Remaining Optimization:**
- ⚠️ Currently rebuilds entire TF-IDF index on each change
- Could optimize to only update affected documents
- Need benchmarks for large codebases

**Impact:** Search results now always up-to-date

---

### 4. AST & Symbol Search (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status:** ❌ Text-based search only

**Current Limitation:**
- Can't search for specific symbols (functions, classes, types)
- No structural understanding
- No go-to-definition
- No find-references

**Needed:**
- AST parsing (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Symbol extraction
- Symbol index
- Structural search queries

**Impact:** Limited search capabilities, can't replace LSP features

**Estimate:** 4-6 weeks (Phase 3)

---

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status:** ❌ No automation

**Missing:**
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing on PR
- Type checking in CI
- Linting in CI
- Automated releases
- npm publishing workflow

**Impact:** Manual release process, no quality gates

**Estimate:** 3-5 days

---

### 6. Code Quality Tools (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status:** ❌ No linting/formatting

**Missing:**
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- Pre-commit hooks (husky)
- Strict TypeScript mode

**Impact:** Inconsistent code style, potential bugs

**Estimate:** 2-3 days

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Performance
| Limitation | Impact | Future Solution |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Single-threaded indexing | Slow for large codebases (>10k files) | Worker threads |
| In-memory only | High memory usage | Persistent storage |
| No query caching | Repeated queries re-compute | Result caching |
| No index compression | Large memory footprint | Compression |

### Search Accuracy
| Limitation | Impact | Future Solution |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Text-based only | Can't understand code structure | AST parsing |
| No type awareness | Can't search by type | Type index |
| No semantic search | Can't find similar code | Embeddings |
| Simple tokenization | Misses complex patterns | Advanced NLP |

### Scalability
| Limitation | Impact | Future Solution |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| No distributed indexing | Can't handle massive repos | Index sharding |
| No multi-repo support | One repo at a time | Multi-repo indexing |
| No incremental updates | Re-index on change | Smart incremental |

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ Monorepo structure - easy to manage
2. ✅ TypeScript - caught many bugs early
3. ✅ MCP integration - seamless with Claude
4. ✅ Simple TF-IDF - good enough for v1.0

### What Needs Improvement
1. ⚠️ Should have started with tests
2. ⚠️ Persistent storage should have been in v1.0
3. ⚠️ Need benchmarks from the start
4. ⚠️ Documentation written after code (should be concurrent)

### Future Design Principles
1. **Test-first** - Write tests before implementation
2. **Benchmark early** - Measure performance from day 1
3. **Incremental from start** - Don't build full re-index only
4. **Plugin architecture** - Design for extensibility upfront
